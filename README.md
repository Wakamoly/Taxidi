# Taxidi
Taxidi, a modern load board. This is a simulated Minimum Viable Product.

# Why?
Owner-Operator truck drivers often plagued by brokers that give them work, only to take a large percentage of the pay-per-mile rate.
What if we could close the gap on third-party brokers?
This app is a simulated environment that shows that users can sign-up as either Businesses (unfinished) or Drivers (in-progress) and view an interactive map.

# The App - Driver
The map shows drivers multiple points on the map that indicate businesses that have a shipment that needs taken and gives the drivers the option to see details.
From there, the driver can offer to pick up the load and take it to it's destination for a pay-per-mile rate listed in the details of the load.
The driver is given a generated pick-up ticket to present to the warehouse manager, then, after the load has been picked up, the driver then carries the load to it's destination
where they are once again generated a ticket for drop-off to present to that warehouse manager. Once the load has been dropped off and confirmed, both the driver and business can
then review one-another.
